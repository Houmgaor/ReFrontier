# ReFrontier

Tools for \*packing, \*crypting and editing various Monster Hunter Frontier Online files.

Huge thank you to enler for their help!

## Usage

Use ``dotnet build`` to compile ReFrontier.
It will be generate an executable file in `Refrontier/bin/Debug/ReFrontier.exe`.

Now, you can either drag-an-drop files/folder onto this executable, or open a terminal at the location of the executable file.

To get help, use:

```shell
./ReFrontier.exe
```

You will see the following options:

```text
Unpacking Options:
-log: Write log file (required for repacking)
-cleanUp: Delete simple archives after unpacking
-stageContainer: Unpack file as stage-specific container (for certain stXXX.pac files and maybe others)
-autoStage: Automatically attempt to unpack containers that might be stage-specific (this is very experimental, since there is no reliable way to detect a stage-specific container)
-nonRecursive: Do not unpack recursively (useful for modifying specific files in archives, also check -noDecryption/-ignoreJPK)
-decryptOnly: Decrypt ecd files without unpacking
-noDecryption: Don't decrypt ecd files, no unpacking
-ignoreJPK: Do not decompress JPK files

Packing Options:
-pack: Repack directory (requires log file  - double check file extensions therein and make sure you account for encryption, compression)
-compress [type],[level]: Pack file with jpk [type] at compression [level] (example: -compress 3,10)
-encrypt: Encrypt input file with ecd algorithm

General Options:
-close: Close window after finishing process
```

## Decrypt/decompress

ReFrontier does decryption (ECD â†’ JPK) then decompression by default.

You simply need to drag and drop the path of the file or folders of ReFrontier you want to decrypt.
It can also depack folders.

Decompressing a file *replaces* the old file by its new format, don't forget to backup important data.

If you want to reuse the file in the game, don't forget to add ``-log`` to generate a .meta file.
If you file is named "mhfdat.bin", the meta file will be mhfdat.bin.meta.

## Data edition

Once the files are decrypted and decompressed, you can edit them.
You can use the tools in the [see also](#see-also) section.

This project also includes FrontierTextText and FrontierDataTools to extract text and data from the files respectively.

## Compress

To compress it again JPK type 4 compression use:

```shell
./ReFrontier.exe mhfdat.bin -compress 4,100
```

It has the following output on vanilla mhfdat.bin:

```text
File compressed using type 4 (level 1): 9453891 bytes (64,26 % saved) in 0:04.48
File compressed using type 4 (level 2): 8589271 bytes (67,53 % saved) in 0:06.84

[...]

File compressed using type 4 (level 95): 6045761 bytes (77,15 % saved) in 2:04.26
File compressed using type 4 (level 100): 6045761 bytes (77,15 % saved) in 2:05.03
Vanilla file from COG with type 4       : 5363764 bytes (79,72 % saved)
```

The output will be a file, or a folder with the same name in the `output/` directory.

## Encrypt

To a encrypt a *compressed* file use:

```shell
./ReFrontier.exe mhfdat.bin -encrypt
```

It will implicitely look for mhfdat.bin.meta file in the same folder, see the [decryption](#decryptdecompress) section.
The file can now be used in Frontier.

## Disclaimer

Repo made public as of 2019-07-17 on occasion of the game in question being shutdown in December 2019.
Tool was intended for personal use only, so it might be a bit messy to foreign eyes.
You're likely looking for ReFrontier itself and can safely ignore the other tools.
